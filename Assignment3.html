<p>All my life, I lived in Marlyand.  I went to the Calverton school for 6 years and made my way to Miami for college.  Miami opened me to a new world that I fell in love with.  There are so many oppurtunities in both places I live, given that I am only twenty minutes from D.C. in my hometown and Miami is full of significant people.  </p>


<h1 id="myFamily">My Family</h1>

As I grew older, school took up much of my time.  Now that I am in college, I show him new tricks that I have learned with computers.  Shopping has always been very therapuetic for me and spending time with family is always fun.</p>

<h1 id="myLife">My Life</h1>
